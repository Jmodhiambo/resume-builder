1. User visits the home page and registers or logs in.  
2. After login, they're redirected to the **dashboard**.  
3. From the dashboard, users launch the **Resume Builder**:
   - Fill in forms for Personal Info, Education, Experience, Skills, etc.
   - Preview the resume in real-time.
   - Click “Download as PDF” to export the resume.
4. (Optional) Users may select from different resume templates, save sessions, or share resumes online.
